# Compiler
This project is a custom compiler for a programming language, written in Python. It focuses on lexical analysis to break down source code into tokens for keywords, operators, constants, and other elements. Additionally, it performs syntax analysis to ensure the code follows predefined rules, validating the program's structure.
